This is a Full Stack on its own, on the client. Modern, component-oriented UI frameworks, together with state-action paradigms (like Flux and its most popular implementation, Redux) have formalized a lot of new concepts. And this radically changes the way we think our architecture. How do we distribute our business logic? How do we keep things in sync? Do we actually need a backend? How do we keep components reusable? A lot of new practices have emerged and we feel that Relay will be the next big thing. We are shifting to a development environment that will give us more and more resources to focus on what really matters: the user, the experience, the product. Let's get ready for the next leap.\"\n          },\n        \"name\": \"Luca Marchesini\",\n        \"slug\": \"luca-marchesini\",\n        \"track\": \"front\",\n        \"twitter\": \"https://twitter.com/xbill82\",\n        \"tagline\": \"Full stack engineer: Docker, ElasticSearch, Redis, Webpack, AngularJS, VueJS.\"\n      }\n        ,\n\n      {\n          \"talk\": {\n            \"title\": \"Clients in control: building demand-driven systems with Om Next\",\n            \"description\": \"Traditional architectures are no longer suitable for the increasing needs of today's applications. The price is often paid in high bandwidth and reduced performance. Demand-driven design enables clients to request arbitrary data on demand. Companies like Facebook and Netflix have switched to demand-driven architectures to better embrace a great variety of continuously changing clients. Solutions like Relay and Falcor/JSONGraph distill such ideas. Om Next builds on, and extends these concepts further, to provide a Clojure(Script) based solution. In this talk, I present the motivation for a demand-driven approach and explore the benefits and tradeoffs that Om Next brings to the table.\"\n          },\n        \"name\": \"Ant√≥nio Nuno Monteiro\",\n        \"slug\": \"antonio-nuno-monteiro\",\n        \"track\": \"front\",\n        \"twitter\": \"https://twitter.com/anmonteiro90\",\n        \"tagline\": \"Clojure enthusiast.
